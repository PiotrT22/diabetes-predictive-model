# Jupyter Notebook for Diabetes Prediction Task

## Task Description
In the attached dataset, you will find information about female patients, particularly related to diabetes. The task consists of two main parts:

1. **Data Preparation and Analysis**
   - Thorough examination of the dataset.
   - Conducting statistical analysis.
   - Initial data visualization.

2. **Predictive Modeling**
   - Building a predictive model for the outcome variable.
   - Using logistic regression to predict the presence of diabetes.
   - Evaluating the model's performance.

## Input Data
The CSV file contains the following columns:
- `Pregnancies` - number of pregnancies the patient has had.
- `BMI` - body mass index.
- `Blood Pressure` - blood pressure level.
- `Insulin` - insulin level.
- `Age` - age of the patient.
- `Outcome` - the target variable indicating whether the patient has diabetes (1 - yes, 0 - no).

## Implementation
In this notebook, logistic regression was used as the predictive model.

## Requirements
- Jupyter Notebook
- Python Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn
